demo_questions.py
-----------------
Member C responsibility: design demo questions that showcase all three
database systems working together.

Run this before your demo to verify each question works:
    python demo_questions.py

Each question is mapped to:
  - Which database(s) it exercises
  - The expected query path
  - A sample expected output format
